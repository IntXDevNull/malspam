This workshop is a hands-on introduction to malspam investigation.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This workshop includes real malware samples. Use appropriate caution. If you're unsure what that entails, consult someone knowledgeable or research proper precautions before starting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Setup

### Virtual Machine

**Remnux VM** is the recommended OS for reverse engineering these samples due to already having most of the needed tools pre-installed.

### Tools Used

The following (non-exhaustive) list of tools will be used during the workshop:

- **VS Code** ‚Äì For syntax highlighting and editing (included in Remnux)
- **7-Zip** - For file extraction/content extraction (git clone https://github.com/decalage2/oletools)
- **Oletools** - For analyzing OLE files. (included in Remnux) 
- **lnkinfo** ‚Äì For inspecting LNK (shortcut) files. (Install through Remnux repo's: liblnk-utils)
- **Peepdf** - For analyzing and extracting information from PDF files (included in Remnux)
- **Wireshark** - Network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect data packets (included in Remnux)
- **MSItools** - For working with MSI files, including extracting and modifying installation packages (included in Remnux)
- **Bless** - Hex editor used for editing/inspecting binary files (Install through Remnux repo's: bless)
- **Onedump.py** - Working with one-note files (Fetch from: https://github.com/DidierStevens/Beta/blob/master/onedump.py)
- **Cyberchef** - Decoding payloads etc. (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

*Note:* You may substitute these tools with alternatives or other ways of solving the different cases.

## üöÄ How to Use

All cases follow the same process:
1. **Unpack `stage1.7z`**  
   All Stage 1 samples are encrypted with the password `infected`. To decrypt, use:
   ```bash
   $ 7z x stage1.7z -pinfected

# Your Mission

The goal is to investigate the file within to determine:

1. Is it malicious? If so, find:
2. IOCs
  - URLs / IPs
  - filepaths
  - regkeys
  - binaries
3. other relevant IOCs to use for detection/remediation

Repeat this for all stages until you end up with either a congratulatory text-file or a `.exe`/`.dll`.

## Tips and Tricks

It is advised to:

- Hash files before starting analysis. (Keeps a clear trail, and helps detect unwanted alterations).
- Filehashes can be added to virustotal to verify if there are records on the file.
- Some examples may not be malicious, but appears as they are due to how different tools analyze its content.
- Note steps taken, and commands run for repeatability.

## NB!

If the folder contains a `stage2.7z` or other variants, they will always unpack with the `downloadURL` as the password. E.g., `stage2.7z` for `putty.msi` would unpack as follows:  
`$7z x stage2.7z -phttps://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.81-installer.msi`
These URL's are mostly dead, so this way it is possible to simulate a download of the file/payload.
